Using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data


* Created a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* The Script will also display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* The Script will add conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The Script will also return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* The script will also run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.
